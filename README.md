# Prophage-SOS-dependency-Predictor(PSP) 
PSP is a novel bioinformatics tool to predict prophage induction modes by analyzing the heterology index (HI) of LexA protein binding to target DNA, classifying prophages into SOS-dependent (SdPs) and SOS-independent (SiPs).
## Dependencies
* PSP is a Python script that relies on:
```Biopython
DIAMOND
MEME
Python3
sklearn
```
## How to run
